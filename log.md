# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nothing yet. It's the first, starting day

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking to continue the FreeCodeCamp progress for front-end development certification. This envolves some projects.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript - Repeat a string](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string)
